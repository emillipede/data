# North Korean Geography

This data collection includes geographic files for top-level North Korean administrative divisions, similar to states and counties in Western countries. North Korea's top-level geography consists of **provinces** — both automous cities (Pyongyang, the capital, for example) and state-sized provinces (Kangwon, for example). Also included here is a secondary layer of geography for **counties**, known as *gun* in Korean, which are smaller municipal subunits.

These province and county files are uploaded in several formats, including ```geojson``` and ```topojson```, which can be used in web applications, and shapefiles, which can be used with common GIS software. All three file types also come with simplified versions for national-level presentations. 

In addition, there's a ```topojson``` file with rivers and lakes. *I'll try add more geographic features and data types in the future*. 

The data are courtesy [DIVA-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org/datadown). 

**Note:** *The provinces file has been edited by me for clarity (and to include some waterways that cut through the geographic boundaries)*.

Enjoy.
