# North Korean Geography

This data collection includes geographic files for top-level North Korean administrative divisions, which are similar to states and counties in Western countries. 

North Korea's top-level geography consists of what I've labeled here generally as **provinces**. These are both autonomous cities ([Pyongyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang), the capital, for example) and actual provinces ([Kangwon Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangwon_Province,_South_Korea), for example). Also included here is a secondary layer of geography for I've labeled as **counties**. Most of these are known as *gun* — like counties — in Korean. Others are just municipal subunits, such as [Kaesong city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong), for example. 

These province and county files are uploaded in several formats, including ```geojson``` and ```topojson```, which can be used in web applications, and ```shapefiles```, which can be used with common GIS software. All three file types also come with simplified versions for national-level presentations. 

In addition, there's a ```topojson``` file with rivers and lakes. *I'll try add more geographic features and data types in the future*.

**NOTES:** 

*1. The provinces file has been edited by me for clarity (and to include some waterways that cut through the geographic boundaries)*.
*2. Like geography in [South Korea(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_South_Korea)], administrative divisions in North Korea can be confusing for Westerners. Read a primer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_North_Korea) to learn more.*
