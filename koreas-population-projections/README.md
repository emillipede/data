# Population Changes on the Korean Peninsula

This data includes historic and future population figures for South Korea and North Korea. The data are pulled from the United Nations' [population program](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/). 

The data include population totals (and projections) but also density (in square kilometers) and annual growth rates from 1950 to 2095. 

The data were used in [this post](http://thedailyviz.com/2017/10/24/common-ground-between-north-and-south-korea-aging-and-shrinking-populations/) at [The Daily Viz](http://thedailyviz.com).
