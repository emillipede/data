# The DMZ

South Korea and North Korea are separated by a "[Demilitarized Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone)" — a buffer along the 38th Parallel created in the armistice that ended the Korean War.

The border zone, which is 2.5 miles wide, runs about 160 miles across the Korean peninsula, splitting the two countries.

The zone boundaries have been formatted as shapefiles, which can be used in GIS software, but also in topojson and geojson for web applications. 

Data extracted from the global [Large Scale International Boundaries](https://catalog.data.gov/organization/cbb2bfc8-a7d9-4a2f-a530-097a7a5fde6e?tags=lsib) database.

Enjoy.
