# White House Staff Salaries: 2017
Each year, the White House is required to deliver a report to Congress listing the title and salary of each employee. The Trump administration made [this disclosure](https://www.whitehouse.gov/staff-salaries) in the summer of 2017.

The White House unfortunately released a [flat, 12-page PDF](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/disclosures/07012017-report-final.pdf) file — essentially a paper copy of the data for all 377 employees. 

I've converted (thanks, [Tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula)) that data into a more readable CSV format, and I've also parsed the employee names. 

Hope this is useful.
