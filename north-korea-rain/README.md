# Rain in (parts of) North Korea

This data includes historic precipitation data for several locations around North Korea. The data are pulled from Weather Underground monthly history pages for a dozen weather monitoring stations across the country. The data include more than 10,000 monthly observations from January 2005 to October 2017.

The locations of each weather station are included in the table below, with links to the monthly reports from October 2017. Changing the URL structure ( the year or month or station ID) will return different records, depending on the date and location.

The stations were geocoded using common tools, such as Google Maps. North Korean geography can be tricky, however, so please [let me know](mailto:mattstiles@gmail.com) if you spot any errors.
