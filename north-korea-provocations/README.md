# North Korean Military Provocations: 1958-2017

These data include 275 incidents, known as provocations, by North Korea since 1958. These events includes missile launches, nuclear tests and other provocations, such as rocket engine tests, Demilitarized Zone incursions and firearms exchanges. 

The first dataset, which contains a record for each incident, has eight fields:

Field | Description
------------ | ------------- 
**date** | Event date
**year** | Event year (added to original data)
**month** | Event month (added to original data)
**weekday** | Event weekday (Sunday=1) (added to original data)
**type** | Event category (missile, nuclear, other)
**event** | Semi-categorized description of the event
**description** | Brief narative description of the event
**media** | URL of media story or government statement detailing event

*The original data contained two similar "type" categories — "other" and "other provocation" — which have been combined.*

The second dataset, which contains an annual summary by incident type created by me, has five fields:

Field | Description
------------ | ------------- 
**year** | Event date
**missile** | Missile tests and launches
**nuclear** | Nuclear developments
**other** | Other provocation type
**total** | Annual provocation count
