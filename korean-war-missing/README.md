# Unaccounted for Troops from the Korean War

This data includes information about the more than 7,000 American troops whose remains were never recovered during the Korean War. The data were released by the [Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency](http://www.dpaa.mil/Our-Missing/Korean-War/Korean-War-POW-MIA-List). 

The data include numerous fields, including each troop's name, rank and service branch. Also included are each service member's home state and the incident date (including the day, month and year when they went missing). **I've included the population of their respective states as of 1950, according the U.S. Census.** 

The data were used in [this post](http://thedailyviz.com/2018/7/18/visualizing-the-korean-wars-missing-troops/) at [The Daily Viz](http://thedailyviz.com).
